## **Week 1: (Date: 11/03/22 -- 11/04/22)**

### Weekly Goals
Decide our project goals and finish our project proposal. If possible, start working on the project.

This week, we as a group discussed details about project goals and completed project proposals.
Ruijia and Ellen worked together on writing the team contract.
Yue opened the project git repository and added required members to the project.
Encheng and Yue have significantly contributed to the initial design of the project’s data structure for storing the graph while other members have added comments. 
All members contributed for writing the project proposal.

### Problems Encountered 
This week went smoothly as we didn’t encounter any unsolvable problems inside our group.

### Plans for next week
Our plan for next week is to finish writing the data structure and storing the dataset into a functional graph. We also plan to start implementing a function of finding the shortest path between two airports (given departure and arrival) using the Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and start writing the test case for this function.
