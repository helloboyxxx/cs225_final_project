# Development Logs

## **Week 1: (Date: 11/03/22 -- 11/04/22)**

### Weekly Goals
Decide our project goals and finish our project proposal. If possible, start working on the project.

### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
This week, we as a group discussed details about project goals and completed project proposals.
Ruijia and Ellen worked together on writing the team contract.
Yue opened the project git repository and added required members to the project.
Encheng and Yue have significantly contributed to the initial design of the project’s data structure for storing the graph while other members have added comments. 
All members contributed for writing the project proposal.

### Problems Encountered 
This week went smoothly as we didn’t encounter any unsolvable problems inside our group.

### Plans for next week
Our plan for next week is to finish writing the data structure and storing the dataset into a functional graph. We also plan to start implementing a function of finding the shortest path between two airports (given departure and arrival) using the Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and start writing the test case for this function.

### Optional: Questions for mentor
None

## **Week 2: (Date: 11/05/22 -- 11/11/22)**

### Weekly Goals
Set up the dataset and work on the graph. Implement BFS traversal for the graph. Start implementing the shortest path algorithm with Dijkstra’s Algorithm. If possible, write test cases for shortest path (Dijstra’s)

### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Monday(11/07/22)

All members set up github and local dock containers. We also tested and got familiar with git branch.
Yue wrote naive_strucutres.h which contains the initial ideas of our data structure of the graph.

Tuesday (11/08/22)

Encheng:
Developed structure files that contain all structs needed for the project.
Developed class receiving and converting data file to operable code structure (graph).

Yue Chen:
Mimicked the CMakeLists in our MP and lab in our project so that we can use cmake to compile our file easily in the future. 

Friday (11/11/22)

Ellen Yang, Ruijia Lyu, Yue Chen:
Worked on Graph files that contain all the functions we need for Dijkstra’s algorithm.
Start working on implementing BFS and Dijkstra’s files.

### Problems Encountered 
This week we didn’t encounter any unsolvable problems inside our group.

### Plans for next week
Our plan for next week is to finish implementing the shortest path algorithm with Dijkstra's algorithm. And prepare for the mid-project checkpoint. We also plan to start implementing the busiest airports with the betweenness centrality if we have the time. 

### Optional: Questions for mentor
We are wondering if we need to write operator++ for BFS.
