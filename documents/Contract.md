# Team Contract
## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will meet on Friday and Sunday afternoons from 2:00 to 5:00. We will meet offline in a study room in Grainger Library. If a study room in Grainger Library is not available during the meeting time, we will consider another library’s study room or empty classrooms. We will take turns taking notes during the meeting if necessary. We will use Sunday morning as a backup meeting time if one of the two above meeting times does not work for the week. 
2. **Assistance** 
We have contact information of other team members through phone numbers, discord, or WeChat. We would expect responses within one hour for texted communications. If we require a faster response, we will use phone calls.
3. **Respect** 
We shall listen to each other’s ideas and value each other’s opinions. We encourage each member to be actively engaged during meetings.  
## Collaboration
4. **Work Distribution** 
Everyone will have their own branch at the repo to push each individual part. And will merge all work together during the meeting. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
We expect six hours minimum (during the meeting time) for work. If there is any additional work that is not finished during the meeting time, each member would use extra time to finish their work at their own availability.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If a disagreement arises, we will first try to communicate within the group and try to come up with a solution. If not, we will reach out to our mentor for help and suggestions. If a member can’t accomplish his/her tasks, he/she should first inform the other members and try to catch up with the current schedule. We will try to make the schedule more flexible in consideration of unforeseen time conflicts or emergencies arising during the final project. If a member is habitually late, we will report this situation to our mentor.
